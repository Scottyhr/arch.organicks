        <h2>Mycelial Insulation</h2>
        <p>Mycelial insulation begins with the growth of the mycelium in a controlled environment until the mycelium has developed over the substrate. The mixture is then sprayed into cavity walls, where it continues to grow and provide full insulation within 6 months.</p>
